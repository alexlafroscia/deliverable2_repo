Deliverable 2 Repo

## Gradle

The first time that each command is run, replace `gradle` with `./gradlew`.  This will tell the application to also go and download some files and stuff that it needs.  Every other time, you should be fine to just run `gradle` by itself, but it doesn't hurt to run it as `./gradlew` every time.

**Build Project**

```
$ gradle build
```

**Run Tests**

```
$ gradle test
```

**Generate test coverage report**

```
$ gradle jacoco
```
